# Observations CDK Constructs Library
An extension of the AWS CDK, providing multi-service, well-architected patterns to accelerate secure delivery of infrastructure.

Please review the [Catalogue](CATALOGUE.md) to determine if there is an existing construct to solve your problem.

## Motivation

To apply the [Don't Repeat Yourself](https://dzone.com/articles/is-your-code-dry-or-wet) principle of software development to the infrastructure layer.

## Influencing Projects
  * [AWS CDK Patterns](https://cdkpatterns.com/patterns/) and associated [GitHub repo](https://github.com/cdk-patterns/serverless)
    * Inspiration behind naming conventions for abstract CDK Constructs.
  * [AWS Solutions Constructs](https://aws.amazon.com/solutions/constructs/patterns/)
    * Lots of prototype and experimental patterns that can often fit our needs, but require additional testing and robustness adding.

## Contributing

Morpheus maintain this repo, but welcome use and contributions from anyone in the Met Office deploying systems using the AWS CDK in Python.

If there are aspects of your system that can be abstracted in line with [the Construct concept](/documentation/what_is_a_cdk_construct.md) then please raise a PR following the [Contributing guidelines](CONTRIBUTING.md).
